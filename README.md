👋 Hey there! I'm Rucha, and I'm on a journey to explore and share my passion for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. This GitHub account serves as a canvas where I document my academic and personal projects, share my insights through machine learning blogs and notes, and provide solutions to Leetcode challenges in SQL and Python.

🤖 As a Data Scientist, I'm constantly navigating the vast sea of data to make informed decisions and create strategic solutions. What sets me apart is my commitment to using AI for enablement rather than just establishment, driven by a strong sense of empathy. Throughout my life, I've held one belief close to my heart: "Continuous learning is the key." I seize every opportunity that challenges me, even if it means having a full plate. Over time, I've become more adept at managing this ever-increasing feast of knowledge and experiences.

🌐 In my perspective, the world is governed by science and patterns, and I'm here to uncover and understand them.

📌LANGUAGES: Python(Numpy, Pandas, NLTK, Spacy, Keras, SKlearn, Matplotlib), Java

📌DATA SOURCING: SQL (Oracle, MySQL, Redshift), NoSQL (MongoDB, Graph Databases), Advanced Excel

📌DATA PREPROCESSING: pandas, NumPy, NLTK, spacy, keras, sklearn

📌 DATA VISUALIZATIONS  QuickSight, Tableau, plotly, seaborn, matplotlib

📌 MACHINE LEARNING:Regression algorithms, Clustering, Ensemble Methods, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Natural Language Processing, Conversational AI, Natural Language Understanding (NLU), RASA, Search Algorithms

📌DEEP LEARNING: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) , Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) , Transformer-based Language Models (LLMs) 

📌CLOUD SERVICES: AWS EC2, AWS Redshift, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), AWS S3, AWS Sagemaker
