Hey! Thanks for stopping by. Here is what you should know about me.

The word Potential has a lot of potential and I am chasing my own.

I am a machine learning student with strong problem solving navigating solution through data driven decisions and strategy; Fueled with empathy, I aim to use AI for enablement rather than establishment. 
Ever since childhood one thing I strongly believe is in 'learning'. I try to grab every opportunity that challenges me. Sometimes it's a hard struggle to have too much on my plate but yes I am getting better at managing that too! 

I have done my bachelor's of engineering in Information technology, completed post graduate diploma in AI ML from IIITB and currently pursuing MSc in AI at the Heriot Watt University Edinburgh and I am thoroughly enjoying it.
